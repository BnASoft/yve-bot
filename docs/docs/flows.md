# Flows: Grouping rules
To organize your conversation definitions, you can group the rules using the flow concept:

```yaml
- flow: identify
  rules:
    - Welcome
    ...

- flow: question
  rules:
    - How can I help you?
```

### Jumping between flows

You can jump between flows using `flow_name.rule_name` notation in the `next` property.

```yaml
- flow: identify
  rules:
    - Welcome!
    - message: Your name?
      name: name
      type: String
    - message: Thanks!
      next: question.help
    - Skip

- flow: question
  rules:
    - message: How can I help you?
      name: help

# bot> Welcome!
# bot> Your name?
# usr> Anderson
# bot> Thanks
# bot> How can I help you?
```

This notation is only required if you want to jump to another flow, but you can use just the rule name to jump inside the current flow.

```yaml
- flow: identify
  rules:
    - message: One
      next: two

    - message: Two
      name: two
      exit: true

- flow: another
  rules:
    - Skip it

# bot> One
# bot> Two
```
